I was there when an undergraduate piped up and said “I’d like to write
a PL/1 compiler” and Negroponte thought that was a perfectly
reasonable idea.  That compiler was used to write Magic.

I’ve sent an inquiry to Andrew Lippman who is still at the Media Lab
to ask about archives, and one to Mark Miller who I found on LinkedIn.
I’ll let you know...

I left in 1976 to go off to grad school and by then Magic was
certainly the system we all used, but I don’t think it had VM yet.  It
did have networking.  Lippman and I built a 5 Mbps ring network for
the half-dozen x/32s.

I’ll let you know.
