These machines are 3600's in E15, the new Media Lab.  The building
connects to the campus spine, thus is Internet.  There are a couple
Chaos hosts in the building which can (and occasionally do)
communicate, but there is no Chaos connection to the outside world.

It may be in the future that the MINITS bridge ARCMAC-HUB will get
reconstituted in order to connect the ARCMAC Magic-6 hosts to
the real world again.  If so, it might be necessary to boot it from
MIT-EMS, which is also in the building, and if so, MIT-EMS might
then assume MIT-MC's chaos address -- it's easier than cutting a
new rom for ARCMAC-HUB.  For this and other reasons, we chose not
to publicise chaos hackery within E15.  No one outside should ever
see any of it.
