Subject: Subnet 34 repaired


	I re-attached a connecter out of which a cable had been pulled
in the 5th floor building 36 phone closet. In the process of tracking
down the trouble, I also removed the loop of subnet 34 that used to
go to ARCMAC, so subnet 34 now only goes to buildings 20, 36, and 38.

Thanks to Mike McIlrath and Telecommunications for help and keys,
respectively.

	- Gill
