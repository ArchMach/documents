To be clear, I'm pretty sure the previous version of MAGIC (which was
possibly worked on / developed but never installed) was MAGIC 5. So the 6 may
have come from two different places.

Also for the record, as I'm not sure it has been said yet, MAGIC stood for
Markapetrous (sp) and Gregory Interactive Computer. (I believe M and G were
the two main developers of MAGIC.)
