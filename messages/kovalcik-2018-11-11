I agree with what most of Ted said except the way I got involved in ArchMac.
Which matters little to this story:

 I got involved (in Fall 1975 IIRC) through UROP to work on the ArchMach
 graphics project to do drawing recognition. That project probably had a
 more interesting name. I was involved in a subset of it to do something
 like "Latch" where you take endpoints that are close together and the
 user probably mean to be the same and actually join them up. My memory of
 that is fuzzy other than I remember part of it was one of the first times
 I wrote a UI and my UI sucked. (Every time you ran the program, the user
 was presented with "Please type in the 40 parameters."). Steve Mann and
 Chris Herot were the primary staff members involved with the project I
 was brought on board to do.
 I eventually moved to working on working user space utilities as Ted
 notes.

Also, I think Ted also wrote a text formatter similiar to runoff. I forget
the name of that, but perhaps this would jog Ted's memory.

As to actual source code? If there aren't backups at the MediaLab somewhere
or possibly on some old Multics backup tape, I have no idea. But as Ted said,
even if you find them, good luck reading them.

I hope this helps a little. If you think of more questions, please let me
know.
