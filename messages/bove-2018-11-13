I haven’t seen the disk packs for a long time (and anyway without the drives 
they’d be useless) but in the past couple of years I've run across some 9-track 
tapes -- I recall seeing the Movie Map database among them -- in one of the 
storage closets at the lab.  Not sure if they still exist after recent 
construction projects and group-moves here.
