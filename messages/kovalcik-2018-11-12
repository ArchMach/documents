MagicSix was a complete re-write, mostly in PL1. The previous version was
MAGIC 5.0. Mike Kazar chose the name; I believe to say that it followed on
from MAGIC but was quite different. MAGIC was written is assembler btw. otv
sounds vaguely familar but TVMacs is not ArchMach or post 1979.

The compiler used was a subset of PL1 (I don't remember all the differnces)
and was written by Seth Steinberg.
