Hi Lars,

I'm afraid I don't have any copies of any of the software. Perhaps
someone at the MIT Media Lab does; if anyone does, probably Andy
Lippman would be someone to start with, since he's one of the few
names of people who are still there now, and where also there when I
was there.

I'll try to provide more details of the actual OS in a later email
when I get a chance in the next few days.  It's been 40 years, so I'm
afraid my memory is somewhat spotty.

    Mike
