Lars-

This would be a long shot and I can’t get to even hunting until
January, but it’s possible that I have printouts of code from the
Votrax code in my boxes of old school things. That is - if the storage
locker wasn’t raided, the contents aren’t waterlogged, the printouts
haven’t faded, and *if* I can find them. I wouldn’t have any magnetic
backups, and if there are any, they’d be on reel tape and probably
hard to read after al these years.

Are any of the machines sill in existence? I haven’t been in touch
with the group in years, and my contacts there were Walter (long gone
from there) and Chris Schmandt (just retired).

Good luck finding anything and if you do, please keep me in the
loop. I’d love to have some of the old code.

Howard
