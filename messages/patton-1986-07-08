I remember playing MAzeWars between multiple IMLAC computers at both the MIT
Architecture Machine Group and at Project MAC around 1974.  At that time it
was not used much since it was old hat and evrybody at been hacked out on it.
The IMLACs were vector graphics single user computers several of which would
use some common machine to act as control (it just passed messages, didn't
actually participate).  In the case of ArchMach the host was an Interdata
machine running the MAGIC operating system, at Project MAC (now LCS) the
host was a PDP-10 (MIT-DM) running ITS.  It was said that the version on the
PDP-10 could use the network to allow multiple net hosts to act together as
one control and that Stanford (or someone out west anyway) also had an
implementation and that cross-country games had been played.  The rumor was
that this was stopped when ARPA noticed that more than 50% (the number may
be apocryphal) of the traffic during some period was cross-country MazeWar
packets.
