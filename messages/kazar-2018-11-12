It's hard for me to put myself back in the brain of 19 year old Mike Kazar.
But as Rick said, MagicSix was a completely new OS, so, I figured we could
generate our own typography/logo.

As to why we went to version 6, I can't be certain. But if I had to bet on
something, it would be that it's an homage to The Prisoner, which at the time
was by far the most surrealistic show on TV, and very popular with people I
hung out with. I have a very vague recollection of The Prisoner logo, with a
'6' on the large wheel of the bicycle, as a disk pack label, as well. For
example,

I don't remember exactly what subset of PL/1 that Seth's compiler
implemented, but my vague recollection was that PL/1's 'controlled' storage
class wasn't implemented (reading docs now, controlled storage is clearly a
bizarre feature that I'm guessing never made it into any other language). The
PL/1 subset was sort of like what you'd find in C today, pointers, static
variables and locals.

I don't recall any specific ITS influence -- MagicSix was primarily
influenced by stealing as many ideas from Multics as we could figure out how
to implement on an Interdata. But ITS, Multics and MagicSix hackers all hung
out together, and I don't doubt there was all sorts of cross-pollination, and
I'm sure we borrowed ideas from ITS as well.
