Sort of a strange question.  Are you interested in the software or the
backup media itself?  Or the OS itself?

I was one of the last Magic 6 users, until, I'd say, about 1988.   I
used one of our machines as an audio server long after we'd migrated
to early Suns because they were not fast enough to run Unix and also
play glitch-free audio.  Walter Bender was another of the die hards.

We used to back up to mag tape, 1600 bpi 8 track reels IIRC.  We also
used to make backups by mirroring our disks (300 Mb back then).   We
had no IT people to do backups and just did them from time to time
when we felt we had stuff worth saving.  Very ad hoc.  Anyway, I
haven't seen any of the backup media in a good 20 years and although I
was a heavy user from 1978 until the end, I can't recall that I've
saved any of my source code anywhere.  I am pretty confident about
this because I am retiring in a few months and have been cleaning out
my office, so I would have noticed any old tapes or such.
