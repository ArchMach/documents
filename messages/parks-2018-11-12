M.A.G.I.C., with the periods, was the name prior to MagicSix. It was based on
the names of the creators, as noted below. In the dark recesses of my mind
M.A.G.I.C. did not evolve much further after version 3. I believe version
four was just coming up in 75/76 and had something to do with shared disks
(don’t hold me to this). I think version 5 was never anything. I believe Mike
(who after all was responsible for the name) was right about the prisoner
allusion. The biggest influence on the system by far was Multics. ITS was not
directly influential except through applications like Emacs and the Chaosnet
network. Ted Anderson wrote SINE the editor in a lisp like language
environment after Stallman’s EMACS.
